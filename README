jbig2dec is a decoder library and example utility implementing the JBIG2
bi-level image compression spec. Also known as ITU T.88 and ISO IEC
14492, and included by reference in Adobe's PDF version 1.4 and later.

The basic invocation is:

    jbig2dec [-o <output file>] file.jbig2

It also supports separate 'global' and 'page' streams, generally
extracted from some embedded format:

    jbig2dec [-o <output file>] <global_stream> <page_stream>

The program is only partially functional at this time, but should be
useful in some limited contexts. We welcome files that the decoder can't
handle, or renders incorrectly.
