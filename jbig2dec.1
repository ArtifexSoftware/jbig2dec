.SH NAME
jbig2dec \- File format converter specialized in JBIG2 decoding

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jbig2dec
.RI [ options ]
.I file.jbig2
.br
.B jbig2dec
.RI [ options ]
.I global-stream page-stream

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B jbig2dec
command converts JBIG2 files to png or pbm files.

When passed a single
.I file
argument it is interpreted as a JBIG2 file stream, with either
sequential or random-access organization.

When passed two stream arguments, they are interpreted as the
global and page-specific portions of an embedded organization,
as used in PDF. If a particular page references no global
segment stream, /dev/null can be passed for the
.I global-stream
argument to request the embedded parser.

.SH OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.TP
.BR -e ", " --embedded
Expect embedded bit stream without file header.
.TP
.BI -o " file" ", --output" " file"

.TP
.BR -v ", " --verbose
