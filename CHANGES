Version 0.19 (2020 September 10)

* API change to use full 32 bit segment numbers, in accordance
  to the JBIG2 specification.

* Better handling of end of input data stream and and when
  encountering errors in the arithmetic decoder stream. This
  should improve many situations where jbig2dec appeared to
  run forever.

* Fix several bugs related to signedness or over-/underflow
  checks that were not robust.

* Bug fixes for issues reported by Coverity/OSS-fuzz.

* Add option to limit memory usage to command line tool.

* Update manpages, and command line tool usage.

Version 0.18 (2020 February 11)

* Performance enhancements related to decoding of MMR and generic
  regions as well as composing images onto pages.

* Bug fixes for a few issues reported by Coverity and OSS-Fuzz.

Version 0.17 (2019 September 16)

* Improved test suite by verifying input file contents and adding
  all ubc test streams. Fixed bugs where previously missing ubc
  test streams were decoded incorrectly.

* Bug fixes for a few issues reported by Coverity.

* Moved version number to jbig2.h, and adapted configure
  correspondingly. Added pkg-config file to be installed
  along side library.

Version 0.16 (2019 April 04)

* API change allowing for library users to get the custom allocator
  so it may be freed if necessary. This is useful if the allocator
  is extended with e.g. a custom pointer needed by the allocator
  callbacks.

Version 0.15 (2018 September 04)

* Bug fix release, with many security related and stability fixes
  as well as better tolerance/behaviour with out of spec files

Version 0.14 (2017 October 04)

* Bug fix release.

Version 0.13 (2016 April 07)

* Bug fix release.

Version 0.12 (2014 October 1)

* Bug fix release.

Version 0.11 (2010 February 2)

 * Support for generic regions with typical prediction (042_8.jb2)
 * Correct bitmap offsets with transposed text (042_19.jb2)
 * Autotools build now uses libtool and provides a shared library
 * Manpage for jbig2dec
 * Code cleanup and robustness fixes

Version 0.10 (2009 May 28)

 * Security fix for malicious symbol dictionaries CVE-2009-0196
 * Fix various resource leaks and error handling issues
 * Dynamically allocate huffman symbol length histogram to save space
 * Support aggregate symbol coding
 * Work around invalid Xerox WorkCentre streams which write the
   final segment length as -1
 * Fix an issue with huffman table runcodes

Version 0.9 (2006 July 27)

 * striped page support
 * successfully decodes ubc test streams 042_9, 042_20

Version 0.8 (2005 April 6)

 * Fix an allocation error in the page array
 * properly handle non-OR image composition operators
 * Fix a UMR bug in the compositor
 * successfully decodes ubc test streams 042_12,15,16,17,18
 * various memory leak fixes

Version 0.7 (2004 December 8)

 * properly initialize page buffers
 * refinement region handling
 * successfully decodes ubc test streams 042_21, 042_22 and 042_23
 * generic region template 3 handling with arbitrary AT locations
 * successfully decodes ubc test streams 042_6 and 042_7

Version 0.6 (2003 December 31)

 * minor portability fix for cygwin

Version 0.5 (2003 December 4)

 * compiler warning fixes
 * Properly handle the export specification for symbol
   dictionaries.
 * successfully decodes multipage documents from the
   Adobe encoder.

Version 0.4 (released 2003 August 1)

 * redid license header to simplify relabelling for commercial
   distribution, borrowing from Ghostscript.

Version 0.3 (released 2003 May 20)

    - some templates not working
 * decodes arithmetic symbol dictionaries
 * decodes artithmetic text regions
